Task1:

why string is called as global datatype

Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

Task2:

create float ===> convert in to int str bool
create int ==> conver in to float str bool
create bool ===> convert in to float int str
create str ===> convert in to int float bool


a=10.01
print(int(a))
10
print(str(a))
10.01
print(bool(a))
True

b=25
print(float(b))
25.0
print(str(b))
25
print(bool(b))
True

c=True
print(float(c))
1.0
print(int(c))
1
print(str(c))
True
